# Autoregressive Model Project README

## Introduction
This project trains an autoregressive model using LSTM networks on brackets and NDFA datasets, focusing on sequence generation.

## Project Structure
- `Autoregressive_Model.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with model training and evaluation.
- `data_rnn.py`: Python script for dataset downloading and preprocessing.

## Installation
Requires Python 3.x and libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, etc.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Run `data_rnn.py` for dataset download and preprocessing.
2. **Model Training**: Execute `Autoregressive_Model.ipynb` for the entire process, from data loading to model evaluation. The notebook is compatible with Google Colab GPUs. 
3. **Results Analysis**: Review the output for performance insights.

## Features
- In-depth LSTM Model architecture.
- Detailed data processing methods including embedding and tokenization.
- Comprehensive training methodology.
- Thorough evaluation of results with quantitative and visual analysis.
